## Explanation

The intent of BlocJams was to get used with javascript, html, css and external API (Buzz) syntax & techniques through the creation of a website which has the look and taste of a Spotify replica.

## Problem

The main challenge was to have all the javascript working and doing what they were created for. Problems were coming from:
1)limited knowledge of all the javascript syntax.
2)Not yet all the automatism to debug unworking javascript scripts
3)Interacting between Jquert and vanilla javascript

On html css, not 100% confortable with positions in order to place the elements where i was envisioning them to be.

## Solution

For javascript using the console and placing console.log() elements really helped to understand how to debug things. Discovering the atom feature higlithing correspinding bracket, parenthesis and curly bracket really helped too.  

## Results

It took on some elements longer than i was expecting particularly on some javascript functions, but once using debugging automatism it became much easier and BLOCJAMS website is now working as it should.

## Conclusion

BlocJams was a the perfect exercise to get used with website development concepts and as many things in life the more you do in life the easier it becomes!
